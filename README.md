### Sentiment-Analysis-Model

This project was developed during the Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree. At the project we aim to develope an LSTM model to identify the sentiment based on text data,
after that we used AWS (Amazon) to train and deploy the model, ans using yet the AWS structure, we developed the endpoint, the Lambda structure and the 
API for permit the user to interact with the Sentiment Analyse Model.
